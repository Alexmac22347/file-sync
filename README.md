Use this to sync files between a phone and PC.
Eg, if you put a huge compilation on your phone,
    then go through and delete songs you dont like
    from your phone, you can delete the same songs
    from your pc as well.
    Or if you add a bunch of songs to your phone
    or PC, this will copy them over
