Use this to sync files between a phone and PC.
Eg, if you put a huge compilation on your phone,
    then go through and delete songs you dont like
    from your phone, you can delete the same songs
    from your pc as well.
    Or if you add a bunch of songs to your phone
    or PC, this will copy them over

TODO:
- allow window resizing
- prompt user for paths when new config is created
- if locally added files are already there in remote, just 
  add them to the config. same goes for remotely added files
  which already exist locally.
  similar thing for deleted files
