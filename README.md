Use this to sync files between a phone and PC.
Eg, if you put a huge compilation on your phone,
    then go through and delete songs you dont like
    from your phone, you can delete the same songs
    from your pc as well.
    Or if you add a bunch of songs to your phone
    or PC, this will copy them over

TODO:
- allow window resizing
- prompt user for paths when new config is created
- Make gui class deal only with GUI
- Remove empty folders after all the files have been deleted from them 
- Create directory if it doesnt exist
