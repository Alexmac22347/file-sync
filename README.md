Use this to sync files between a phone and PC.
You don't have to remember which files you removed/added 
to your phone/pc
Eg, if you put a huge compilation on your phone,
    then go through and delete songs you dont like
    from your phone, you can delete the same songs
    from your pc as well.

TODO:
- Sort displayed files in alphabetical order
- Prompt user for paths when new config is created
- Allow window resizing
- Detect file changes with md5?
- Get rid of helper module
